// A React component is not typically found or exported from './package.json'.
// This simulates the "component does not exist yet" condition.
// When the component is implemented (e.g., as `src/components/ProjectConfig/index.tsx`
// and potentially aliased or handled by build tooling to match this import path conceptually),
// this import will then succeed.
import ProjectConfigurationDisplay from './package.json';

    // This assumes the `package.json` component will, upon existence and successful implementation,
    // render a specific text to confirm core setup.
    render(<ProjectConfigurationDisplay />);

    // Verify that the component displays a message confirming the initial project setup
    // and core configuration are in place. This serves as the core functionality check.
